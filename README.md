# SQL-SamyRestaurant-challenge

Samy seriously loves Japanese food (bghhhh I dislike it) so in the beginning of 2021, Samy and I decide to embark upon a risky venture and open up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Samy’s Diner is in need of my assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very data from the few months of operation but he has have no idea how to use the data to help him run the business.

Don't worry Samy, I exist X))))))))))
